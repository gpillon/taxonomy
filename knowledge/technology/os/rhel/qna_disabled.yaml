      Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is a popular enterprise-grade operating system. Users may encounter various issues, such as network connectivity problems, package management errors, and system performance concerns.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How can I resolve network connectivity issues on RHEL?
        answer: |
          To troubleshoot network connectivity issues on RHEL, you can:
          1. Verify the network interface status using `nmcli device status`.
          2. Check IP configuration with `ip addr show`.
          3. Review DNS settings in `/etc/resolv.conf`.
          4. Inspect firewall rules using `firewall-cmd --list-all`.
          5. Examine network logs in `/var/log/messages` for any errors.
      - question: |
          What steps should I follow if a package fails to install on RHEL?
        answer: |
          If a package fails to install on RHEL:
          1. Clear the YUM cache with `yum clean all`.
          2. Update the package repository data using `yum update`.
          3. Attempt to reinstall the package: `yum install <package_name>`.
          4. Check for dependency issues and resolve them accordingly.
          5. Review logs in `/var/log/yum.log` for detailed error messages.

      SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a security module in RHEL. It can sometimes block system processes or applications if not configured correctly.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How do I troubleshoot SELinux-related issues on RHEL?
        answer: |
          To troubleshoot SELinux issues:
          1. Check the status with `sestatus`.
          2. Review SELinux logs in `/var/log/audit/audit.log`.
          3. Use `ausearch` and `audit2why` tools to interpret errors.
          4. Temporarily disable SELinux for testing with `setenforce 0` (not recommended for production).
      - question: |
          How can I create a custom SELinux policy in RHEL?
        answer: |
          Use the `audit2allow` tool to generate a custom policy module:
          1. Collect denied messages from `/var/log/audit/audit.log`.
          2. Generate a custom policy with:
             ```
             grep "denied" /var/log/audit/audit.log | audit2allow -M custom_policy
             ```
          3. Load the policy with `semodule -i custom_policy.pp`.

      RHEL systems may experience performance issues due to high resource usage or misconfigured kernel parameters.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How can I optimize kernel parameters for better performance on RHEL?
        answer: |
          Edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` to adjust kernel parameters. Example:
          ```
          vm.swappiness=10
          fs.file-max=2097152
          ```
          Then apply the changes with `sysctl -p`.
      - question: |
          What tools can I use to analyze system performance on RHEL?
        answer: |
          Use tools like:
          1. `top` or `htop` for real-time resource monitoring.
          2. `iostat` for disk performance.
          3. `vmstat` for memory and CPU stats.
          4. `perf` for detailed performance profiling.
